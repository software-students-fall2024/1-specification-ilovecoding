## Product Vision Statement

Empower NYU Computer Science students to efficiently plan their academic journey by tracking completed courses and generating personalized long-term course plans based on their individual goals and preferences. 

## User Requirements

1. As a new NYU CS student, I want to input my completed CS courses so that I can track what courses I still need to take.

2. As a returning user, I want to be prompted to add any newly finished courses when I sign in so that my course tracking is always up to date.

3. As an NYU CS student, I want to see a list of all remaining required courses and electives so that I can plan my path to graduation.

4. As an NYU CS student, I want to select my graduation semester so that I can see a realistic long-term plan of courses I need to take each semester.

5. As an NYU CS student, I want to specify my preferred work direction (e.g., front-end, back-end) so that the app can suggest relevant electives that align with my career goals.

6. As an NYU CS student, I want to decide whether or not I’ll take courses during the summer or winter semesters so that I can create a personalized plan that fits my schedule.

7. As an NYU CS student, I want to view detailed information about each course (e.g., workload, technologies taught) so that I can make informed decisions about which courses to take.

8. As an NYU CS student, I want to see which professors are teaching the courses next semester so that I can choose sections based on professor reviews and teaching styles.

9. As an NYU CS student, I want to be able to view links to professor reviews (e.g., on RateMyProfessors) so that I can better understand what to expect in each course.

10. As an NYU CS student, I want the app to notify me if it’s impossible to complete my courses before my intended graduation date so that I can adjust my plan and timeline accordingly.
